## The Decision We All Face
Often you have one of two choices to make: push forward or roll back.  Rolling
back can often require you to revert changes made to the main branch.

This is different than `git restore` since we are not restoring a file to a
previous commit, but instead we are removing an entire commit from the graph.

If the commit is matter, this is the anti-matter move

## Git Revert
Reverting is simple.  You just need to provide the commit(ish).
```bash
git revert <commitish>
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

### Problem
Navigate to `hello-git` project and revert commit with log message `E`.  Before
removing it, check the contents of the commit via `log` with `-p`!

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

### Solution
```bash
➜  hello-git git:(trunk) git log --oneline

```

Using log -p to look at the contents of E using `--grep` and `-p`
```bash
➜  hello-git git:(trunk) git log -p --grep E

Revert E

Auto-merging README.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md

hint: After resolving the conflicts, mark them with
hint: "git add/rm <pathspec>", then run
hint: "git revert --continue".
hint: You can instead skip this commit with "git revert --skip".

### HALT
Yes, conflicts  can happen while reverting. Lets fix the conflict and finish
this revert.  Resloving them are a lot like rebase.  figure out the code you
want to keep and `git revert --continue`

```bash
➜  hello-git git:(trunk) ✗ git status
On branch trunk
You are currently reverting commit a665b08.
  (fix conflicts and run "git revert --continue")
  (use "git revert --skip" to skip this patch)
  (use "git revert --abort" to cancel the revert operation)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
        both modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

`git status` shows the conflict is within README.md

```bash
A + 10
D
<<<<<<< HEAD
E
remote-change
downstream change
=======
>>>>>>> parent of a665b08 (E)
```

You can see right away that one change set contains
```bash
E
remote-change
downstream change
```

and the other contains nothing (our revert commit).

This means that git cannot tell how to revert this commit cleanly.  We can help
by keeping the contents below E but removing E

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

### Problem
Finish the revert by fixing the conflict then use `git revert --continue`

use git log to see what the revert looks like

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

### Solution
Merge conflict fixed

```bash
A + 10
D
remote-change
downstream change
```

Now, just like rebase, we have to `git revert --continue`

```bash
➜  hello-git git:(trunk) ✗ git add .
➜  hello-git git:(trunk) ✗ git revert --continue

Revert "E"

This reverts commit a665b08996994c2e6620a6367b0ab524be221cb2.

# Conflicts:

The commit message contains a nice message explaining exactly what commit you
revert if any history looker decides to peruse the commits.  A git log -p -1
shows the contents of the change too

```bash

    Revert "E"

    This reverts commit a665b08996994c2e6620a6367b0ab524be221cb2.
